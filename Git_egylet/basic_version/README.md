# Pac-Man (v.1 by Git-egylet)

Pac-Man, originally called Puck Man in Japan is a 1980 maze action video game developed and released by Namco as an arcade game. Originally, the player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts.

Now, our team decided to remake the game from ground as an assignment within the "Agile software development" class.

## Installation

Clone the project folder function from our repository: https://github.com/gujgidani/bosch_ASDIIE_Git-egylet

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

## Run and control the game

This is what you should type in to start the game:

```bash
python3 pacman.py
```

Press the following buttons on the keyboard to control the movement of Pacman:

| Direction | Responsible button |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Up        | 0                  |
| Right     | 1                  |
| Down      | 2                  |
| Left      | 3                  |

# Milestones

Already done in v.1:
- Map loading without walls
- Step function to control events
- Direction control for Pacman
- Pellet generator and point counter
- Variable game duration (terminate after given time)

Yet to be done:
- Place walls on the map
- Generate the ghosts

Git-egylet as a team tries to keep the principles of "clean coding" prior to everything else.
